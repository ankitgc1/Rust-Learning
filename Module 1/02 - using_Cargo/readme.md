Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.

run these commands

$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo

$ cargo build
 This will build the Project
